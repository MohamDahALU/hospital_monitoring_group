## heart_rate_monitor.sh
For this script, you just need to run it by entering "./heart_rate_monitor.sh" in the terminal. Then it will prompt you to enter the monitor name. Let's say the user entered "Monitor_2", the script will then run a subscript in the background that logs heart rate information indefinetly in a file called "heart_rate_log.txt", and it will print the process ID in the terminal. You can use the PID that was printed on the "kill" command to terminate it.
